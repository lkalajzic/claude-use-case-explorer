# Claude Use Case Explorer + ROI Calculator

## Project Overview

A comprehensive tool for helping companies identify and evaluate Claude implementation opportunities. The project enables businesses to:

1. Analyze their company profile to identify suitable Claude use cases
2. Calculate ROI projections based on role-specific employee data
3. Explore real-world implementation examples with documented outcomes
4. Generate implementation plans with cost and timeline estimates

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, Flask
- **Frontend**: Next.js, JavaScript
- **API Integration**: Anthropic Claude API

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features

- Company analyzer for website and description analysis
- Use case database with ~74 real case studies
- Basic ROI calculator with industry benchmarks
- Next.js frontend with interactive UI

### In Progress

- Enhanced company analyzer that extracts employee role information
- Role-specific ROI calculations for more accurate projections
- Improved matching algorithm for use cases

## Key Components and How They Work

### 1. Company Analyzer

- Located in `backend/analyzers/company_analyzer.py`
- Uses Claude API to analyze company descriptions or websites
- Extracts industry, size, challenges, and employee role distribution
- Matches company profiles to potential Claude use cases

#### Key Methods:

- `analyze_description(description)`: Analyzes text description of a company
- `analyze_website(url)`: Scrapes and analyzes a company website
- `match_use_cases(company_analysis)`: Matches analysis to potential use cases

### 2. ROI Calculator

- Located in `backend/app.py` (calculate_roi endpoint)
- Uses benchmark data to project cost savings and ROI
- Currently being enhanced to support role-specific calculations

### 3. Frontend Components

- Company analyzer form: `frontend-next/src/app/analyzer/page.jsx`
- ROI Calculator: `frontend-next/src/app/roi-calculator/page.jsx`
- Use case explorer: `frontend-next/src/app/use-cases/page.jsx`

## Next Steps for Implementation

# Implementation Steps for Claude Use Case Explorer (note - some of these might already be done - but may or may not function properly)

## 1. Enhance Company Analyzer

- Update the Claude prompt to extract role-specific employee counts
- Modify JSON response structure to include detailed employee distribution
- Create a mapping between job roles and applicable Claude use cases
- Add confidence scoring for role detection

## 2. Build Form Review UI

- Create editable form component displaying extracted company data
- Add input fields for each employee role category with validation
- Include toggles for enabling/disabling specific use cases
- Design a confirmation step before calculation

## 3. Use Case Matching System

- Implement algorithm to match employee roles to specific use cases
- Set up relevance scoring based on company details and role counts
- Create filter logic to prioritize high-impact use cases
- Build system to pull real metrics from case study database

## 4. Extend ROI Calculator

- Modify calculator to handle role-specific calculations
- Create aggregate ROI calculation combining all selected use cases
- Implement confidence intervals based on case study variance
- Add time-based projection with adjustable parameters

## 5. Results Dashboard

- Design metrics display with source citations and confidence levels
- Create separate sections for each matched use case with metrics
- Add links to relevant case studies with implementation details
- Build comparison view between different use case combinations

## 6. Data Integration

- Connect case study metrics to specific use cases
- Extract implementation cost data from case studies
- Set up data pipeline to ensure consistent metrics format
- Create fallback values for missing data points

## 7. Testing & Deployment

- Implement end-to-end testing with sample companies
- Optimize API calls to reduce latency
- Add caching for frequently accessed case study data
- Set up analytics to track user engagement with different features

# Current state

Important: Claude 3.7 and I tried implementing the next steps with some parts going wrong. We left off at test_enhanced_analyzer.py, which not only returns an error, but does it after mistakenly thinking the goal is to match the user's company with the companies in case studies rather than recommending claude for those specific use cases that each of the companies in the case studies benefited from.
