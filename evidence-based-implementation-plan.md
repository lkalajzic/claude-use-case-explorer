# Evidence-Based Use Case Implementation Plan

## Overview: The Big Picture

We're transforming the recommendation system from theoretical suggestions to evidence-based examples organized by business function. Instead of generic implementation ideas and benefits, users will see real-world examples with concrete metrics from actual companies.

### Current System

- Claude analyzes company profile
- Matches to potential use cases based on role distribution
- Generates theoretical implementation ideas and benefits
- Displays these as separate sections without direct ties to evidence

### New Evidence-Based System

- Claude analyzes company profile
- Identifies ALL relevant business functions, sorted by relevance and potential ROI
- For each function, finds the most impactful use cases
- For each use case, presents real company examples with actual metrics
- Links directly to case studies for deeper exploration

## Conceptual Architecture

```
Company Profile
  │
  ↓
ALL Business Functions (sorted by relevance & potential ROI, eg "Customer Support")
  │
  ↓
Specific Use Cases per Function (e.g., "Automated Query Handling")
  │
  ↓
Real Company Examples with Metrics (e.g., "Asana → 40% reduction")
  │
  ↓
Direct Links to Case Studies
```

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Backend Changes

1. **Fetch Missing Case Studies** ✅ COMPLETED

   - Created `fetch_missing_case_studies.py` script that:
     - Systematically fetches all case studies from anthropic.com/customers
     - Compares with existing case studies to identify ~20 missing ones
     - Uses enhanced extraction prompts with business function categorization
     - Discovers new categories dynamically (e.g., Scientific Research, Healthcare, Education)
   
   **Enhanced extraction captures:**
   - Primary/secondary business functions with specific use case types
   - Role mappings showing which employees benefit
   - Quantitative metrics with source attribution
   - Qualitative benefits with supporting quotes
   - Implementation details and costs

2. **Create Business Function Taxonomy**

   - ✅ Enhanced taxonomy included in fetcher script with new categories:
     - Traditional: Customer Support, Marketing, Sales, Product, Engineering, Legal, Finance, HR, Operations
     - **NEW**: Scientific Research & Academia, Healthcare & Medical, Education & Training, Government & Public Sector, Non-profit & Social Impact
   - Map each to business roles (e.g., Customer Support → Customer Service Representatives)
   - Create a JSON mapping file `business_functions.json` from extracted data

3. **Execute Data Collection & Analysis**

   - **NEXT**: Run the fetcher script to collect missing case studies
   - **NEXT**: Analyze extracted data to discover actual business function patterns
   - **NEXT**: Create categorized_case_studies.json with enhanced structure
   - This will provide evidence-based examples organized by business function and use case type

4. **Modify Company Analyzer Backend (company_analyzer.py)**
   - Update the match_use_cases function to use the new taxonomy
   - Revise the Claude prompt to request evidence-based examples
   - New response structure:
     ```json
     {
       "businessFunctions": [
         {
           "id": "customer_support",
           "name": "Customer Support",
           "relevanceScore": 85,
           "potentialRoi": 125000,
           "useCases": [
             {
               "id": "automated_query_handling",
               "name": "Automated Query Handling",
               "examples": [
                 {
                   "company": "Asana",
                   "caseStudyId": "asana",
                   "implementation": "Implemented Claude to handle tier-1 support tickets",
                   "metric": "40% reduction in agent workload",
                   "metricValue": "40%",
                   "metricUnit": "reduction"
                 }
                 // Other examples
               ]
             }
             // Other use cases
           ],
           "targetRoles": [
             // Keep existing role structure for ROI calculations
           ],
           "totalEmployeesAffected": 150,
           "estimatedImplementationCost": {
             "level": "Medium",
             "range": "$10,000 - $20,000"
           }
         }
         // Other business functions
       ]
     }
     ```

### Phase 2: Frontend Updates

1. **Modify UseCaseMatches.jsx**

   - Replace current grid layout with business function-based organization
   - Create new components:
     - `BusinessFunctionCard` - Container for a business function and its use cases
     - `UseCaseExampleList` - Displays real-world examples for a use case
     - `CompanyExample` - Shows a specific company example with metrics

2. **Update Link Generation**

   - Enhance `formatCaseStudyUrl` function to handle edge cases
   - Create a special case mapping for known problematic company names
   - Add error handling when links can't be generated

3. **Create Visual Hierarchy**

   - Business function cards as main containers
   - Use case sections within each card
   - Company examples as compact items with highlighted metrics
   - Maintain ROI calculation summary at the top

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add business function icons for visual recognition
   - Highlight metrics with accent colors
   - Make company names visually distinct as links
   - Add toggle to expand/collapse business functions

### Phase 3: Claude Prompt Engineering

1. **Create New Claude Prompt Template**

   ````
   You are an AI implementation expert tasked with recommending Claude AI use cases based on real-world evidence.

   ## Company Analysis
   ```json
   {company_analysis_json}
   ````

   ## Available Case Studies

   ```json
   {case_studies_json}
   ```

   ## Business Function Taxonomy

   ```json
   {business_functions_json}
   ```

   ## Your Task

   Based on the company analysis, recommend ALL relevant business functions and evidence-based use cases:

   1. Include ALL business functions that are applicable to the company
   2. Sort business functions by:
      a) Relevance to the company's profile
      b) Potential ROI in dollar value
   3. For each function, identify 2-3 highest-impact use cases
   4. For each use case, provide 2-3 real company examples from the case studies
   5. Each example must include:
      - Company name
      - Brief implementation description (1 sentence)
      - Concrete metric or outcome (with numeric value when available)
      - Case study ID for linking

   Follow these guidelines:

   - Prioritize examples from the same industry when available
   - Focus on examples with clear, impressive metrics
   - Ensure examples demonstrate different approaches to the same use case
   - Maintain the existing role-based structure for ROI calculations
   - Calculate potential ROI in dollar terms for each business function

   Return ONLY a JSON object with the structure defined below...

   ```

   ```

2. **Optimize Prompt Parameters**
   - Set appropriate temperature (0.3-0.5) to balance creativity with accuracy
   - Ensure max_tokens is sufficient for comprehensive response
   - Add system message emphasizing evidence-based recommendations

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

1. **Test with Diverse Company Profiles**

   - Create test cases covering various industries and company sizes
   - Verify business function relevance and example selection
   - Check ROI calculations remain accurate with new structure

2. **Edge Case Handling**

   - Test with companies having unusual role distributions
   - Verify behavior when few relevant case studies exist
   - Ensure graceful degradation if categorized data is incomplete

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Create fallback to more generic examples if specific industry examples unavailable
   - Handle cases where metrics might be missing
   - Provide default structure when Claude's response doesn't match expected format

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- ROI calculations should continue working with minimal changes
- The role-specific data must be preserved alongside the new business function structure
- All existing case study URL routes should remain valid

### Data Structure Alignment

- The existing role-based categories need to map to business functions
- This mapping occurs at two levels:
  1. In the prompt to Claude (guiding its recommendations)
  2. In the frontend (for display organization)

### URL Handling Edge Cases

- Some company names require special formatting for URLs:
  - Names with periods (e.g., "copy.ai" → "copy_ai")
  - Multi-word names (e.g., "SK Telecom" → "sk-telecom")
  - Names with special characters
- Implement a lookup table for known edge cases
- Add fallback URL generation with proper slugification

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Data Preparation (1-2 days)**

   - Create business function taxonomy
   - Analyze and categorize case studies
   - Generate enhanced data structure

2. **Backend Changes (2-3 days)**

   - Update prompt engineering
   - Modify response structure
   - Test Claude responses

3. **Frontend Development (3-4 days)**

   - Create new component hierarchy
   - Implement business function organization
   - Add company example formatting with metrics
   - Update link generation

4. **Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)**
   - Test with diverse company profiles
   - Address edge cases
   - Optimize performance

## Migration Strategy

Rather than rebuilding everything at once, we'll use a phased approach:

1. First, implement the backend changes and test Claude's responses
2. Then, create the new frontend components while maintaining the old ones
3. Once both are working, switch from the old display to the new organization
4. Run parallel tests comparing old and new approaches
5. Finally, remove deprecated components and code

This approach ensures we can revert if issues arise while minimizing disruption to the application.

## Latest Progress Update (December 30, 2024)

### Important Clarifications from Today's Session

1. **We already have the core components built!**
   - ✅ Employee role extraction in company analyzer (company_website_prompt.txt and company_description_prompt.txt)
   - ✅ Form Review UI for editing employee counts and roles  
   - ✅ ROI calculations based on roles in UseCaseMatches.jsx
   - ✅ 115 case studies (45 with new businessFunctions field)

2. **The standardized business functions are already defined:**
   - In the extracted case studies with the new businessFunctions field
   - Most common: Product & Engineering (34), Sales & Marketing (19), Customer Support (17), Operations (14), IT (10)
   - Also: Executive/Leadership (6), HR (3), Legal & Compliance (3), Finance (2), Data Analysis (2)
   - We should limit Claude to ONLY these standardized functions, not invent new ones

3. **What actually needs to be done:**
   - Update the match_use_cases prompt in company_analyzer.py (line ~506) to:
     - Return evidence-based examples organized by business function
     - Include real company examples with metrics from case studies
     - Use ONLY the standardized business functions from the case studies
     - Structure: businessFunctions → examples from real companies → metrics
   - Update UseCaseMatches.jsx to display the new structure with real examples

4. **Key file locations:**
   - Company analysis prompts: `/backend/data/templates/company_website_prompt.txt` and `company_description_prompt.txt`
   - ROI matching prompt: In `company_analyzer.py` in the `match_use_cases` method starting at line 506
   - Frontend display: `/frontend-next/src/components/analysis/UseCaseMatches.jsx`

5. **The complete flow is:**
   ```
   Input (company description/website) 
   ↓
   Claude analyzes and extracts roles (using template prompts)
   ↓ 
   User reviews/edits in FormReview UI
   ↓
   Claude matches to use cases with real examples (match_use_cases method)
   ↓
   Frontend displays examples and calculates ROI
   ```

### Key Differences in the New Approach:

1. **Organization**: By business function instead of individual use cases
2. **Evidence**: Real company examples with metrics instead of generic ideas
3. **Clarity**: "Why this matches" explanation specific to the analyzed company
4. **Proof**: Direct links to case studies for credibility
5. **Simplicity**: Cleaner UI focused on the evidence

### Standardized Business Functions to Use:
- Customer Support
- Sales & Marketing
- Product & Engineering
- Operations
- Information Technology
- Executive/Leadership
- Human Resources
- Legal & Compliance
- Finance & Accounting
- Data Analysis & Research

Remember: The goal is to show real evidence instead of generic suggestions. Every recommendation should be backed by an actual company that achieved specific, measurable results.

## Major Update: Evidence-Based System COMPLETED! (December 31, 2024)

We've successfully implemented the evidence-based recommendation system! The system now shows real company examples with metrics instead of generic suggestions.

## User Testing Feedback & Improvements Needed (January 2025)

After testing the live system, here are the key improvements identified:

## Major Architecture Change: Use-Case-Based ROI Calculation (January 2025)

After careful consideration, we're moving from role-based to use-case-based ROI calculations for much higher accuracy and actionability.

### The Problem with Current Approach:
- Shows evidence like "40% reduction in support tickets" 
- But calculates as if 40% of ALL work hours are saved
- Reality: Support reps don't spend 100% of time on tickets

### New Use-Case-Based Model:

#### 1. Structure:
```
Business Function (e.g., Customer Support)
└── Use Case 1: AI Support Agent
    ├── Hours/week on this task: 15
    ├── Time savings: 40%
    ├── Complexity: Medium
    ├── Prerequisites: API access, ticket system
    ├── Examples: Asana (40%), Intercom (50%), Sendbird (30-40%)
    └── Annual ROI: $468,000

└── Use Case 2: Response Drafting  
    ├── Hours/week on this task: 10
    ├── Time savings: 50%
    ├── Complexity: Low
    ├── Prerequisites: None (can start immediately)
    ├── Examples: Copy.ai, Tidio, Clay
    └── Annual ROI: $390,000

└── Use Case 3: Knowledge Base Creation
    ├── Hours/week on this task: 5
    ├── Time savings: 60%
    ├── Complexity: Low
    ├── Prerequisites: Documentation access
    ├── Examples: Notion, GitLab, Canva
    └── Annual ROI: $234,000
```

#### 2. Key Features:
- **Precision**: Break down EXACTLY which tasks save time
- **Prioritization**: Sort by ROI/Complexity ratio to surface quick wins
- **Readiness Indicators**: 
  - ✅ Ready to start
  - ⚠️ Requires prerequisites
  - 🔒 Depends on other use cases
- **Expandable**: Show top 3 by default, expand to see 5-7 total
- **Editable**: Users can adjust hours/week if they have better data

#### 3. New JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "businessFunctions": [{
    "id": "customer_support",
    "name": "Customer Support",
    "totalEmployees": 150,
    "relevanceScore": 95,
    "whyRelevant": "You have 150 support reps handling high volume",
    "useCases": [
      {
        "id": "ai_support_agent",
        "name": "AI Support Agent",
        "description": "Automated first-line support for common queries",
        "impact": "High",
        "complexity": "Medium",
        "complexityWeeks": 8,
        "hoursPerWeek": 15,
        "timeSavingsPercent": 40,
        "prerequisites": ["API access", "Ticket system integration"],
        "readinessStatus": "requires_setup",
        "examples": [
          {
            "company": "Asana",
            "caseStudyId": "asana",
            "metric": "40% reduction in agent workload",
            "implementation": "Built Claude-powered agent for tier-1 tickets"
          }
        ],
        "annualROI": 468000,
        "quickWinScore": 234 // ROI/complexity
      }
    ],
    "totalApplicableHours": 30, // Sum of all use case hours
    "totalApplicablePercent": 75, // 30/40 hours
    "totalAnnualROI": 1092000
  }]
}
```

#### 4. UI Changes:
- Each business function card shows:
  - Summary: Total employees, % applicable work, total ROI
  - Top 3 use cases with individual ROI
  - "Show more" to expand to all use cases
  - Each use case shows hours/week (editable)
  - Quick win badges on high ROI/complexity ratio items
  - Readiness indicators with tooltips for prerequisites

#### 5. Benefits:
- **Realistic**: No more claiming 40% savings on ALL work
- **Actionable**: Clear implementation roadmap
- **Trustworthy**: Transparent calculations
- **Flexible**: Users can toggle use cases on/off
- **Evidence-based**: Each use case backed by real examples

### Implementation Steps:

#### Phase 1: Backend Changes (4-6 hours)
1. **Update Claude prompt** in match_use_cases to:
   - Return use cases nested within business functions
   - Estimate hours/week for each use case
   - Add complexity ratings and prerequisites
   - Calculate quickWinScore (ROI/complexity)

2. **Enhance case study data** to include:
   - Specific use case types (AI agent, drafting, etc.)
   - Implementation complexity and timeline
   - Prerequisites required

#### Phase 2: Frontend Development (6-8 hours)
1. **Create new UseCaseMatchesV2 component** with:
   - Expandable use case sections (show 3, expand for more)
   - Editable hours/week inputs with live ROI recalculation
   - Readiness indicators with prerequisite tooltips
   - Quick win badges for high-scoring use cases

2. **Update ROI calculation logic** to:
   - Calculate per use case instead of per role
   - Sum up selected use cases for total ROI
   - Account for applicable work percentage

3. **Design improvements**:
   - Clear visual hierarchy: Function → Use Cases → Examples
   - Progress indicators showing implementation complexity
   - Suggested implementation order based on quick win scores

#### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (2-3 hours)
1. Test with various company profiles
2. Validate hours/week estimates are reasonable
3. Ensure calculations are transparent and accurate
4. Add helpful tooltips and guidance

### Migration Strategy:
- Keep both old and new components initially
- Use feature flag or gradual rollout
- Monitor user feedback on new approach
- Remove old system once validated

### 1. Initial Company Analysis Flow
- **Add default placeholder company description**: Pre-populate the description field with employee function templates (e.g., "50 Engineers, 20 Sales, 15 Customer Support...") that users can easily edit
- **Fix misleading loading message**: Currently says "Analyzing against 74 real-world Claude implementation case studies" but at this stage we're just analyzing the company data, not comparing yet
- **Show actual case study count**: When matching, display "Processing against 115 real-world case studies" (the actual count)

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **Remove '+x more' in Business Challenges**: All challenges should be visible by default - no need to hide them
- **Move key metrics to TOP of each business function card**: Annual Savings, ROI%, and Confidence should be prominently displayed at the top, not buried at the bottom
- **Remove redundant 'Roles affected'**: This appears at the bottom of function components but is redundant with the information already shown

### 3. ROI Calculation Updates
- **Update implementation cost calculation**: Use Anthropic's enterprise pricing of ~$100/seat/month (based on community estimates)
- **Add pricing disclaimer**: Note that "$100/seat/mo is an estimate based on community discussions" and add CTA: "Contact Anthropic for accurate pricing" with link to anthropic.com/enterprise
- **Simplify confidence display**: Show as percentage (e.g., "85% confidence") instead of "High/Medium/Low"

### 4. Evidence Display Enhancements
- **Show more examples**: Increase from 2-3 to up to 5 examples per business function when relevant examples are available
- **Include all relevant roles**: Don't filter - show all roles and let users decide based on confidence scores

### 5. System Architecture Questions
- **Review 'Hours per Week' column**: Does this still make sense with the new evidence-based calculation system?
- **Review 'AI CASES' column**: Is this column still relevant or should it be updated/removed?

### Implementation Thoughts & Recommendations

Based on your feedback, here are my thoughts on improvements:

1. **Default Company Description Template** - Excellent UX improvement! We could provide a template like:
   ```
   We are a [Industry] company with approximately [X] employees:
   - Engineering/Development: [X] engineers
   - Customer Support: [X] support representatives
   - Sales & Marketing: [X] sales and marketing professionals
   - Operations: [X] operations staff
   - HR: [X] HR professionals
   - Finance: [X] finance team members
   - Legal: [X] legal/compliance staff
   - Executive/Leadership: [X] executives
   ```

2. **Pricing Model Shift** - Moving from time-savings calculations to seat-based pricing ($100/user/month) is simpler and more transparent. This aligns with how Anthropic actually prices their enterprise plans.

3. **Confidence Percentages** - Showing "87% confidence" is more precise than "High confidence" and helps users make informed decisions.

4. **More Examples** - Showing up to 5 examples provides more evidence and variety, especially when companies want to see multiple implementation approaches.

5. **Hours per Week / AI Cases** - These columns might be legacy from the old calculation method. With the evidence-based approach showing real metrics (like "40% reduction in response time"), these generic estimates may be less relevant.

### Recommended Priority Order

1. **Quick Wins (1-2 hours)**:
   - Fix loading messages and case study count
   - Remove "+x more" expansion
   - Add default company description template

2. **UI Improvements (2-3 hours)**:
   - Move ROI metrics to top of cards
   - Remove redundant "Roles affected"
   - Update confidence to percentage display

3. **Calculation Updates (3-4 hours)**:
   - Switch to seat-based pricing model
   - Add pricing disclaimer with Anthropic link
   - Review and potentially remove legacy columns

4. **Enhancement Phase (4-6 hours)**:
   - Increase to 5 examples per function
   - Add better error handling
   - Test with diverse company profiles

### What We Accomplished Previously

#### 1. Backend Enhancements ✅
- **Updated match_use_cases method** to return businessFunctions instead of useCases
- **Switched from Sonnet to Haiku** for 7x cost reduction ($0.15 vs $0.21 per request)
- **Created enhanced_case_studies.json** consolidating all 45 enhanced case studies
- **Fixed JSON parsing issues** with improved extraction logic
- **Added system message** to ensure JSON-only responses from Claude

#### 2. Frontend Transformation ✅
- **Created UseCaseMatchesEvidence.jsx** - brand new component for evidence-based display
- **Implemented smart format detection** - automatically uses new component when businessFunctions detected
- **Built business function cards** showing:
  - Real company examples with metrics (e.g., "30-40% reduction in inquiries")
  - Links to full case studies
  - Role-based ROI calculations
  - Second-order benefits
- **Preserved backward compatibility** with old useCases format

#### 3. Data Integration ✅
- **Loaded 45 enhanced case studies** with standardized business functions
- **Mapped to 10 core business functions**:
  - Customer Support
  - Product & Engineering  
  - Sales & Marketing
  - Operations
  - Information Technology
  - Executive/Leadership
  - Human Resources
  - Legal & Compliance
  - Finance & Accounting
  - Research & Development

#### 4. Real Results in Production
The system now displays:
- **Business functions sorted by relevance** (95% for Customer Support with 150 employees)
- **2-3 real examples per function** (Sendbird: "30-40% of inquiries redirected to AI")
- **Actual metrics from companies** (Vanta: "113% increase in developer AI adoption")
- **Direct links to case studies** for credibility and deeper exploration

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Test with diverse company profiles** - Validate the system works across industries
2. **Handle edge cases** - Add fallbacks for missing data or API errors
3. **Performance optimization** - Consider caching case studies for faster loading

#### Short-term Enhancements
1. **Expand case study coverage** - Process remaining ~70 case studies to new format
2. **Improve metric extraction** - Standardize how we display different metric types
3. **Add filtering options** - Let users filter examples by industry/company size
4. **Enhance mobile responsiveness** - Optimize the new cards for mobile devices

#### Long-term Vision
1. **Dynamic matching algorithm** - Use ML to improve relevance scoring
2. **Custom benchmarks** - Allow users to input their own salary data
3. **Implementation roadmaps** - Generate step-by-step plans based on examples
4. **Success tracking** - Follow up on implementations to refine predictions

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Haiku over Sonnet**: 7x cost reduction with minimal quality impact for structured tasks
2. **Single case study file**: enhanced_case_studies.json for simpler maintenance
3. **Lazy loading**: Evidence component loads on-demand for better performance
4. **Backward compatibility**: Gracefully handles both old and new formats

### Lessons Learned

1. **Structured prompts work better** - Clear JSON schema + system message = reliable output
2. **Real examples > generic advice** - Users trust concrete metrics from named companies
3. **Business functions > use cases** - Organizing by function matches how companies think
4. **Iterative refinement** - Starting with 45 case studies proved the concept

### File Changes Summary

## Progress Update: Use-Case-Based ROI Implementation (January 2025)

### ✅ Completed Today:

1. **Backend Restructuring**:
   - Updated Claude prompt to return use cases nested within business functions
   - Added hours/week estimation for each use case
   - Implemented quickWinScore calculation (ROI/complexity)
   - Added complexity ratings and prerequisites
   - Backend now calculates ROI per use case, not per role

2. **Standardized Business Functions**:
   - Consolidated to 9 clear business functions (was 10+)
   - Separated Sales and Marketing (previously combined)
   - Merged IT into Product & Engineering
   - Updated all templates and code to use consistent naming

3. **Regional Wage Adjustments**:
   - Added geography-based hourly rate multipliers
   - US baseline rates adjusted for regions (e.g., Croatia 0.25x for engineering)
   - Claude now estimates location-adjusted rates transparently
   - Shows adjusted rates in response for user clarity

4. **Our 9 Standard Functions**:
   - Executive/Leadership
   - Sales
   - Marketing
   - Product & Engineering (includes IT/DevOps)
   - Operations
   - Finance & Accounting
   - Human Resources
   - Legal & Compliance
   - Customer Support

### 🚧 Next Steps (Frontend):

1. **Create UseCaseMatchesV2 Component**:
   - Show business functions with nested use cases
   - Display top 3 use cases by default, expand for more
   - Editable hours/week inputs per use case
   - Show readiness indicators (✅ Ready, ⚠️ Prerequisites needed)
   - Quick win badges for high ROI/complexity scores

2. **Update ROI Calculations**:
   - Calculate based on individual use cases
   - Show transparency: hours × time savings × rate × employees
   - Allow toggling use cases on/off
   - Sum selected use cases for total ROI

3. **Testing**:
   - Test with companies from different regions
   - Verify use case hours/week are reasonable
   - Ensure quick win scoring works correctly

### Key Achievement:
The system now provides **actionable implementation roadmaps** instead of vague "40% savings on everything" claims. Each use case shows specific tasks, realistic hours, and real company examples with metrics!

## Critical Issues Found During Testing (January 6, 2025)

### 1. Role Assignment Mapping Problems
**Issue**: When analyzing the B2B SaaS company description, roles weren't properly mapped:
- 200 software engineers → showed as "Select Role" instead of "Product & Engineering"
- 180 customer success → showed as "Select Role" instead of "Customer Support"
- Other roles similarly unmapped

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The role extraction prompt may not have the exact mapping between common job titles and our 9 standardized business functions
- Need to check company_description_prompt.txt and company_website_prompt.txt for role mapping instructions

**Solution**:
- Add explicit role mapping in the prompt templates
- Include common variations (e.g., "software engineers" → "Product & Engineering", "customer success" → "Customer Support")

### 2. Geographic Salary Adjustment Not Working
**Issue**: User set company HQ as India but salaries remained at US levels ($100k for engineers)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The backend is supposed to apply geographic multipliers but it's not happening
- Need to verify if geography is being extracted and passed to the use case matching

**Solution**:
- Ensure geography extraction includes country/region
- Apply multipliers in the match_use_cases method before calculating ROI
- Show adjusted rates transparently in the UI

### 3. UI/UX Issues

#### Sorting and Display:
- **AI Opportunity Assessment** should be sorted high to low by relevance score
- **Examples should be auto-expanded** (not hidden by default)
- **Need comma separators** in large ROI percentage numbers (e.g., "1,250%" not "1250%")

#### Labeling Confusion:
- **"Net Annual (Yr 2+)"** → Change to "Net Annual Savings" or "Ongoing Annual ROI"
- **"Claude Cost"** → Change to "Claude Cost (Annual)" to clarify it's yearly
- **Total ROI display** → Add total ROI at top-right of each business function card

#### Navigation Issues:
- **State persistence**: Calculations are lost when navigating away and back
- **Links behavior**: All external links should open in new tabs (target="_blank")

### 4. Major Functionality Gaps

#### Per-Use-Case Employee Counts:
**Current**: Assumes ALL employees in a function use ALL use cases
**Reality**: Only subset of engineers write docs, only some do code reviews, etc.
**Solution**: Add employee count input field next to hours/week for each use case

#### Limited Examples (1-2 instead of 3):
**Issue**: Showing only 1-2 examples looks unconvincing
**Analysis**: We have 115 case studies, should have 3 examples for most use cases
**Solution**: 
- Audit case study data to ensure good coverage
- Adjust prompt to request 3 examples minimum
- Fall back to similar use cases if exact matches are limited

#### Limited Use Cases Per Function (1-2 instead of 3-6):
**Critical Issue**: Only getting 1-2 use cases per business function
**User Expectation**: 3-6 use cases to show comprehensive benefits

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Token limits**: Current max_tokens might be too low
2. **Prompt instructions**: May not explicitly ask for 3-6 use cases
3. **Model choice**: Using Haiku for cost savings, but might need Sonnet/Opus for richer output
4. **Case study data**: May not have enough variety tagged per function

**Solution Strategy**:
- First, check current max_tokens setting (likely ~2000)
- Increase to 4000-5000 tokens to allow richer responses
- Update prompt to explicitly request "3-6 use cases per function"
- Consider using Sonnet for matching (still much cheaper than Opus)
- Audit case study data to ensure we have variety

## Implementation Priority & Time Estimates

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (4-6 hours)
1. **Fix role mapping** (1 hour)
   - Update both prompt templates with explicit mappings
   - Test with the exact B2B SaaS example
   
2. **Fix geographic adjustment** (1 hour)
   - Verify geography extraction
   - Apply multipliers in backend
   - Show adjusted rates in UI

3. **Increase use cases per function** (2 hours)
   - Increase max_tokens to 4000
   - Update prompt to request 3-6 use cases
   - Test token usage and costs
   - Consider Sonnet if Haiku insufficient

### Phase 2: UI/UX Improvements (3-4 hours)
1. **Add employee count per use case** (2 hours)
   - Add input field in UseCaseMatchesV2
   - Update ROI calculations
   - Default to full employee count with ability to adjust

2. **Fix all display issues** (1-2 hours)
   - Sort by relevance score
   - Auto-expand examples
   - Add comma formatting
   - Fix labels (Yr 2+, Claude Cost)
   - Add total ROI to function headers
   - Make all links open in new tabs

### Phase 3: State & Polish (2-3 hours)
1. **Add state persistence** (1-2 hours)
   - Use localStorage or URL params
   - Restore state on navigation back

2. **Ensure 3 examples per use case** (1 hour)
   - Audit case study coverage
   - Update prompt requirements
   - Add fallback logic

## Key Decisions to Make

1. **Model Selection for Matching**:
   - Current: Haiku ($0.25 per 1M input tokens)
   - Alternative: Sonnet ($3 per 1M input tokens) - 12x more expensive
   - Recommendation: Try increasing tokens first, only upgrade if necessary

2. **State Persistence Method**:
   - Option A: localStorage (simple, client-side)
   - Option B: URL parameters (shareable)
   - Option C: Backend session (most complex)
   - Recommendation: Start with localStorage

3. **Employee Count Defaults**:
   - Option A: Default to 100% of employees, let users reduce
   - Option B: Default to 50-70% based on use case type
   - Option C: Let Claude estimate based on use case
   - Recommendation: Option C with ability to override
