The system uses a multi-agent framework with three layers of AI agents: document processing agents that analyze audit documents and create tasks, task breakdown agents that simplify complex audit tasks, and report generation agents that compile results and produce final audit reports.",
      "problem": "Managing the exponential growth in renewable energy assets requiring safety audits. Traditional power plants might have one large turbine, but renewable energy requires many more individual assets (e.g., 75 wind turbines to match one traditional turbine's output), creating a complex network to maintain. Manual safety audits were taking up to two weeks to complete and becoming an unsustainable drain on resources.",
