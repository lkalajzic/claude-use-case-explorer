Claude processes security information, converts technical findings into clear insights, and helps security professionals understand potential threats without requiring extensive expertise.",
      "problem": "Organizations face sophisticated, targeted cyber attacks that traditional security tools struggle to detect. Security teams collect vast amounts of data but have difficulty quickly identifying critical issues and understanding complex threats in real time. Technical security findings were previously only understandable to experts with years of specialized experience.",

Traditionally, interpreting complex security information required years of specialized experience. Now, Claude helps summarize technical security data into clear insights that any security professional can understand and act on. 'We used to produce a list of results that only an expert in security with 20 years of experience could understand. But anyone else would need training and time to digest,' said Smith."
