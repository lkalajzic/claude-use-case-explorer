The system generates metadata including captions, object detection, scene description, and other attributes with a single click. Claude provides domain-specific detail for images and supports multilingual capabilities for image descriptions.",
      "problem": "Wedia's clients generate thousands of images and videos monthly (20,000-30,000 images) that need to be tagged, organized, and made searchable. Manually tagging this volume of content was time-consuming and led to inconsistent or incomplete metadata. They needed a solution to automatically generate accurate, detailed metadata for images at scale, supporting multiple languages for their global client base.",
