Specifically, Claude helps analyze job titles and roles across different industries and languages, providing context-aware classification that captures industry-specific nuances.",
      "problem": "Aura's initial system struggled to make sense of job titles and roles across different industries and languages. Their manual approach using basic lookups and fuzzy matching couldn't capture crucial industry context (e.g., a Vice President at a bank is mid-level, while in tech it indicates senior leadership). With 200 million titles and industry pairings to analyze in multiple languages, they needed a more sophisticated solution.",
