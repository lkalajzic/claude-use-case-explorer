The platform uses Claude to understand and maintain brand voice consistency across numerous digital touchpoints while preserving the human qualities that make brands distinctive.",
      "problem": "Traditional brand management relies on static guidelines created by agencies that take too long to produce (up to 2 years) and can't keep up with the constant content creation needs across global teams and numerous digital channels. This leads to inconsistency, exhausted teams working across time zones, and a culture of settling for 'good enough' rather than growing brands.",
