      "useCase": "Advolve uses Claude as the central orchestrator of their AI platform to automate the entire digital customer acquisition process. The system generates static creative assets and copywriting, builds an end-to-end system of AI agents that generate and evaluate each asset layer, automates cross-platform campaign configuration, deployment, and optimization, and uses machine learning to allocate budgets dynamically across platforms and adapt content for optimal return on ad spend.",
