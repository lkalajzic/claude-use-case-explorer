      "useCase": "Cove created a visual workspace for AI collaboration, where users can think alongside an AI collaborator in a canvas-like environment. Unlike traditional chatbots, Cove enables exploring ideas visually and non-linearly, mimicking natural thought processes. The AI can create and edit content in the workspace, including text, tables, images, webpages, and PDFs.",

      "architecture": "Dual-model architecture: Claude 3.5 Sonnet handles core reasoning (interpreting user input, editing workspace items, generating new content) while Claude 3 Haiku manages real-time interactions requiring speed (contextual suggestions, low-latency responses for dynamic interface updates).",
      "promptEngineering": "Complex prompting that includes commands for manipulating the workspace (creating cards, editing text, adding columns to tables). The prompt needs to be very prescriptive about syntax in some places while requiring extreme creativity in others. About 70% of the prompt is cached, mostly examples that drive good outcomes.",
      "challenges": "Balancing advanced reasoning ability with fast response time. Creating a complex prompt that could handle both precise syntax requirements and creative outputs.",
      "solutions": "Implemented a dual-model architecture using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning and Claude 3 Haiku for speed. As described by Mike Chu: 'After Claude 3.5 Sonnet generates an answer, we immediately trigger Claude 3 Haiku for quick suggestions, creating a seamless experience for users.'",
